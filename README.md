# Hi there! I'm Kamil Piwowarczyk 👋

### 💻 About Me
Hey! I'm Kamil, a **20-year-old Computer Science student** at WSB Merito. My main interests revolve around **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**, but I started my IT journey back in 2019, tinkering with web development tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Over time, Python and algorithms became my main focus.

I’m a curious learner who enjoys solving problems with code, exploring data, and building projects that challenge me. My goal is simple: keep improving while working on things I enjoy.

### 📁 Projects I’m Proud Of
Here are a few projects I’ve worked on:

#### 🧪 **[Credit Card Fraud Detection Project](https://github.com/kamil7133/fraud_detection)**  
A comprehensive machine learning pipeline project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using various models, preprocessing techniques, and a minimal Streamlit demo.  
**Highlights**:  
- Developed a robust end-to-end pipeline handling imbalanced data with SMOTE, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.  
- Achieved near-perfect fraud detection performance with a finely tuned Random Forest classifier.
- Deployed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time fraud predictions, ensuring consistent inference through proper model and scaler integration.
