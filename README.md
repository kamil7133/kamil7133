# Hi there! I'm Kamil Piwowarczyk 👋

### 💻 About Me
Hey! I'm Kamil, a **20-year-old Computer Science student** at WSB Merito. My main interests revolve around **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**, but I started my IT journey back in 2019, tinkering with web development tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Over time, Python and algorithms became my main focus.

I’m a curious learner who enjoys solving problems with code, exploring data, and building projects that challenge me. My goal is simple: keep improving while working on things I enjoy.
