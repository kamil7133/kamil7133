# Hi there! I'm Kamil Piwowarczyk üëã

### üíª About Me
I'm a 20-year-old Computer Science student at WSB Merito, currently focusing on **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**. My journey in IT began in 2019 with web development, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP. Over time, I shifted my focus to Python, algorithms, and machine learning as I became passionate about data and AI-driven technologies.

With experience as an IT technician and coursework in Python and SQL, I am steadily building a strong foundation in **Big Data** and **Machine Learning**. I recently transitioned from geoinformatics to computer science to fully dedicate myself to data science, algorithms, and AI.


### üìÅ Featured Projects
Here are a few projects that showcase my skills and learning progress:

- **[Weather Data Analysis](https://github.com/kamil7133/Weather_Data_Analysis_with_Pandas_Matplotlib_and_Seaborn)**  
    A comprehensive data analysis project leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to explore, visualize, and model weather data. This project provides actionable insights into weather patterns and incorporates predictive modeling to forecast temperatures.
      **Highlights:**
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting data types, and engineering features for analysis.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating trends, seasonality, and regional variations in weather metrics.
  - Insightful Visualizations: Generating clear and informative plots, including trend lines, seasonal variations, and heatmaps.
  - Predictive Modeling: Using regression techniques to forecast temperature based on key weather parameters. 

- **[Two Merged Lists with Pytest](https://github.com/kamil7133/test_two_merged_lists_with_pytest)**  
  An algorithm to merge two singly linked lists into a sorted list.  
  **Highlights:**  
  - Functions to handle conversion between Python lists and singly linked lists  
  - Comprehensive Pytest unit tests for edge cases like empty lists, duplicates, and varying list lengths  
  - Demonstrates data structure manipulation and test-driven development  

- **[AI-Powered Article to HTML Converter](https://github.com/kamil7133/AI_article_formatter)**  
  An AI-driven application that transforms text articles into semantic HTML using OpenAI's API.  
  **Highlights:**  
  - Converts text articles into structured HTML with detailed image placeholders (`alt` attributes and captions)  
  - Focuses on modularity, robust error handling, and integration with AI models  
  - Includes automated setup and streamlined execution for enhanced usability  

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
