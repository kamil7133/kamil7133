# Hi there! I'm Kamil Piwowarczyk 👋

### 💻 About Me
I'm a 20-year-old Computer Science student at WSB Merito, currently focusing on **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**. My journey in IT began in 2019 with web development, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP. Over time, I shifted my focus to Python, algorithms, and machine learning as I became passionate about data and AI-driven technologies.

With experience as an IT technician and coursework in Python and SQL, I am steadily building a strong foundation in **Big Data** and **Machine Learning**. I recently transitioned from geoinformatics to computer science to fully dedicate myself to data science, algorithms, and AI.

### 📁 Featured Projects
Here are a few projects that showcase my skills and learning progress:

- **[LeetCode Solutions](https://github.com/kamil7133)**: Solving problems on LeetCode and documenting solutions in Python to strengthen algorithmic thinking and coding skills.
- **[Two Merged Lists with Pytest](https://github.com/kamil7133/test_two_merged_lists_with_pytest)**: An algorithm to merge two singly linked lists, along with Pytest unit tests.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch (for CNNs, RNNs)
- **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- **Big Data Tools**: (Learning stage)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Tools**: PyCharm (terminal), MacBook for coding, desktop PC with GTX 1660 Super for CUDA tasks, **Linux (Ubuntu) on Virtual Machine in Azure** for cloud-based development and testing.

### 📈 Goals
I’m working towards building a strong portfolio with real-world projects and am aiming to apply for roles like **AI Developer**, **AI Engineer**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, or **Data Scientist** within the next year. I plan to specialize in **AI and Data Science** at WSB Merito and further enhance my skills in these areas. 

In addition, I am focused on solving 50+ LeetCode problems, developing machine learning projects, and adding function tests to my GitHub repositories. I’m also planning to earn some certifications like **TensorFlow Developer** and **Microsoft Azure AI Engineer**. 

Looking ahead, I intend to expand my expertise by learning **Java**, exploring its applications in AI and software engineering.
